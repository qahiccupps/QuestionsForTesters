#Questions For Testers

To trigger conversations and build connections.

Make a group. Everyone gets a card. 
Take turns to read a question and the options. Pick one. Award points to anyone who predicts your answer.

Points are pointless.


Everyone can give the reason for their choices. People may be open to persuasion.

Alternative: read a question to a group, hear what everyone's answer is.
