# Questions for Testers
questions for a pack of "sussed" cards for the CollabLab

Not a multiple choice – each are plausible alternatives
We need 4Qs per card, with 3 answers each.
Moo do 50 cards, so 2 decks of 25 = 100 qs.
Write 120-150, then bin some.
Ask for qs on twitter
Run past Bart / Eddy
Put on GitHub
Write new instructions following https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57ebcf69725e25b5bb17c740/t/58260f8b6a4963df09e941ef/1478889362501/SUSSED+WONDERLANDS+HOW+TO+PLAY.pdf

Takes maybe 40 minutes to write 20 questions. So 200 questions in a couple of weeks of 40 mins a day. Then 2 weeks to produce. 
If I want this for EuroSTAR, I’ll need to fly, a bit.

Activities...
Need to play sussed wonderlands to see how the Qs work. Need to perhaps go play at a London pub with packs sent?
